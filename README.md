Tetris Game
This Tetris game was developed by Ephrem Ketachew using Python.

Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game in Python. The game features the familiar gameplay where players must strategically stack falling tetrominoes to create complete horizontal lines. As lines are completed, they disappear, and the player earns points. The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing area.

How to Play

Press the spacebar to instantly drop the tetromino to the bottom.
Objective:
Arrange the falling tetrominoes to create complete horizontal lines without any gaps.
